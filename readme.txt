== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this in more than one widget area? =

Yes, this plugin has been made for multi-widget compatibility. Each instance of the widget will display, if wanted, differently than every other instance of the widget.

= How can I style the plugin output? =

The plugin uses several "common" WordPress functions that create standard class and id elements that can be styled in the style.css file
* the classes generated by the post_class() function; and, the id generated by "post-" appended to the_ID() function wrap the general post output
* the plugin class `post-details` wraps the general meta details of the post, such as the Author, Categories, Tags, etc.
* the overall plugin may also be wrapped in a widget "container" class, or id, specific to the theme itself such as (but not limited to): widget, sidebar, left, right, etc.

Create a stylesheet using the name `fcad-custom-style.css`; and save it to the Featured Category Ad Widget plugin folder.
Elements you add into this file will not be overwritten with future plugin updates. With the addition of the display Category Description option an additional class was written into the plugin.
To style the category description displayed add the class 'fcad-cat-desc' to your fcad-custom-style.css file then use your choice of properties to style the text, for example:
`
.fcad-cat-desc {font-style: italic;}
`

= What style elements are specifically generated by the plugin?

The following CSS elements are generated by the plugin code:

* .fcad-featured-category
* .fcad-link
* .fcad-cat-class-< category choice(s) >
* .fcad-cat-desc
* .fcad-clear
* .fcad-content

Additional style elements may be available but are most likely created through WordPress core functionality, the current active Theme, or another active plugin.
